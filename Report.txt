**ABSTRACT**

Predicting player engagement levels in online gaming environments represents a critical challenge in the gaming industry, directly impacting user retention and revenue optimization. This research proposes a multi-dataset machine learning approach using Random Forest to analyze gaming behavior patterns and predict engagement levels with enhanced robustness to data quality variations.

Our methodology includes five key phases: (1) exploratory data analysis with missing value treatment, (2) categorical variable encoding using LabelEncoder, (3) Random Forest training with hyperparameter optimization via GridSearchCV, (4) multi-dataset robustness assessment, and (5) feature importance analysis for business insights.

Experimental results on the primary dataset (40,034 records) achieved 91.0% accuracy, with SessionsPerWeek (42.0%) and AvgSessionDurationMinutes (31.0%) identified as the most critical predictors. Multi-dataset validation on a secondary dirty dataset (200 records) yielded 73.8% accuracy, demonstrating robustness to real-world data quality issues. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods shows superior performance over LSTM models (85%), Support Vector Machines (73%), and gradient boosting algorithms (81%).

The research contributes: (1) a robust multi-dataset validation framework, (2) a production-ready data preprocessing pipeline, (3) comprehensive feature importance analysis, and (4) empirical validation of Random Forest effectiveness in gaming analytics with high accuracy and strong generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

**1. INTRODUCTION**

**1.1 Research Context and Problem Definition**

The global gaming industry has experienced unprecedented growth, reaching over $200 billion in annual revenue with billions of active players worldwide. Understanding and predicting player engagement levels has become crucial for game developers, publishers, and platform operators to optimize user experience, reduce churn rates, and maximize revenue potential. Player engagement prediction involves analyzing behavioral patterns, gameplay metrics, and demographic factors to classify players into different engagement categories (High, Medium, Low), enabling targeted interventions and personalized gaming experiences.

**1.2 Research Challenges and Real-world Applications**

This problem presents several critical challenges: (1) high-dimensional feature spaces with complex non-linear relationships between variables, (2) data quality issues including missing values, outliers, and inconsistent categorical encodings, (3) varying data distributions across different gaming platforms and demographics, and (4) the need for real-time prediction capabilities in production environments. Real-world applications include churn prevention systems, personalized marketing campaigns, dynamic difficulty adjustment, in-game purchase optimization, and player segmentation for targeted content delivery.

**1.3 Current Approaches and Limitations**

Existing methods for gaming behavior analysis primarily rely on traditional statistical approaches, basic machine learning models (logistic regression, decision trees), and deep learning techniques (neural networks, LSTMs). However, these approaches suffer from significant limitations: limited generalizability across diverse datasets, poor robustness to data quality variations, lack of comprehensive feature importance analysis for business insights, and insufficient validation on real-world dirty data. Most studies focus on single-dataset validation, failing to address the practical challenges of deploying models in production environments with varying data quality.

**1.4 Proposed Approach and Novel Contributions**

This research proposes a comprehensive multi-dataset Random Forest framework that addresses existing limitations through four key innovations: (1) robust multi-dataset validation methodology that quantifies model performance across varying data quality conditions, (2) production-ready preprocessing pipeline capable of handling diverse data quality issues, (3) systematic feature importance analysis providing actionable business intelligence, and (4) empirical demonstration of Random Forest superiority in gaming analytics. The novelty lies in the comprehensive approach combining advanced data preprocessing, multi-dataset robustness assessment, and business-focused insights generation, providing both high predictive accuracy and practical deployment readiness for the gaming industry.

**2. RELATED WORKS**

**2.1 Deep Learning and Neural Network Approaches**

Recent studies have extensively explored deep learning methods for gaming behavior analysis. LSTM-based models achieve approximately 85% accuracy by capturing temporal patterns in player behavior sequences, effectively modeling session-to-session engagement transitions. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been applied to analyze spatial gaming patterns with moderate success. **Advantages**: Strong temporal modeling capabilities, automatic feature extraction, and good performance on large datasets. **Disadvantages**: High computational requirements, black-box nature limiting interpretability, poor performance on small datasets, and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. **Relationship to our approach**: While deep learning excels at pattern recognition, our Random Forest framework provides superior interpretability through feature importance analysis and demonstrates better robustness across varying dataset sizes, addressing the practical needs of gaming industry stakeholders.

**2.2 Traditional Machine Learning Methods**

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) achieve 73% accuracy in player classification tasks, while logistic regression and decision trees show more modest performance around 68-70%. Gradient boosting algorithms reach 81% accuracy but suffer from overfitting issues. **Advantages**: Computational efficiency, interpretable results, and stable performance across different datasets. **Disadvantages**: Limited ability to capture complex non-linear relationships, manual feature engineering requirements, and poor scalability to high-dimensional data. **Relationship to our approach**: Our Random Forest method builds upon the interpretability strengths of traditional ML while addressing scalability limitations through ensemble learning, providing both accuracy improvements and robust feature importance analysis for business insights.

**2.3 Clustering and Unsupervised Learning Approaches**

K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering methods have been used for player segmentation, achieving reasonable groupings but lacking predictive capabilities for engagement levels. Matrix factorization techniques show promise for recommendation systems but limited accuracy for engagement prediction. **Advantages**: No requirement for labeled data, effective for exploratory analysis, and useful for discovering hidden player segments. **Disadvantages**: Lack of predictive accuracy for specific engagement levels, difficulty in determining optimal cluster numbers, and limited business actionability without supervised validation. **Relationship to our approach**: While unsupervised methods provide valuable insights for initial data exploration, our supervised Random Forest framework delivers actionable predictions with quantified accuracy, essential for production deployment and business decision-making.

**2.4 Hybrid and Ensemble Methods**

Some researchers have explored combining multiple algorithms through voting classifiers or stacking approaches, achieving modest improvements over individual methods. However, these approaches often suffer from increased complexity without proportional performance gains. **Advantages**: Potential for improved accuracy through model combination and reduced overfitting risk. **Disadvantages**: Increased computational complexity, difficult interpretability, and challenge in identifying optimal combination strategies. **Relationship to our approach**: Our Random Forest framework inherently incorporates ensemble principles through decision tree aggregation while maintaining interpretability and computational efficiency, providing the benefits of ensemble learning without the complexity overhead of hybrid approaches.

**3. ANALYSIS OF DATASET CHALLENGES**

Working with both the primary (clean, large-scale) and Vietnam (dirty, small-scale) datasets presented several unique challenges not fully addressed in previous studies:

**3.1 Data Quality and Consistency**
- The Vietnam dataset contained numerous missing values, inconsistent categorical encodings (e.g., 'mười', '###'), outliers (negative and extremely high values), and non-standard formats, while the primary dataset was clean and well-structured.
- Previous research typically focused on single, well-curated datasets, rarely addressing real-world data quality issues or the need for robust preprocessing pipelines.

**3.2 Feature Distribution and Demographic Differences**
- The Vietnam dataset was restricted to young players (age 15-25) and a single location, resulting in different feature distributions and engagement patterns compared to the global dataset.
- Most prior works did not evaluate model robustness across demographic or regional subgroups, limiting their generalizability.

**3.3 Encoding and Compatibility**
- Ensuring consistent label encoding and feature engineering between datasets was critical for valid cross-dataset prediction, especially given the presence of new or missing categories in the Vietnam data.
- Existing studies often overlooked encoding mismatches, leading to reduced model transferability.

**3.4 Data Size and Imbalance**
- The small size of the Vietnam dataset (150 records) increased the risk of overfitting and reduced statistical power for evaluation, while the primary dataset provided robust training.
- Prior research generally relied on large, balanced datasets, with limited discussion of small-sample or imbalanced scenarios.

**3.5 Real-World Applicability and Robustness**
- Applying a model trained on clean, global data to a dirty, local dataset tested the true robustness and generalization of the approach, revealing a 17.2% drop in accuracy (from 91.0% to 73.8%).
- Most published works reported high accuracy on clean test sets but did not assess performance degradation on noisy, real-world data.

**Comparison to Prior Work:**
- Unlike previous studies that focused on ideal, single-source data, this project demonstrates the importance of multi-dataset validation, advanced data cleaning, and encoding consistency for real-world deployment.
- The observed challenges and solutions highlight the need for more practical, robust approaches in gaming analytics research, bridging the gap between academic benchmarks and production environments.
